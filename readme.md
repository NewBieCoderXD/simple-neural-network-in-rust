# Simple neural network implementation in Rust from scratch

The purpose is to study neural network and gaining experience in Rust

I decided to create a documentation of how to derive equations and implementation guide for educational purpose in [this page](https://newbiecoderxd.github.io/simple-neural-network-in-rust/html/main.html)

**Please note that this is according to my understanding of the topic, so please proceed with caution.**

**If you believe I've made a mistake in this project, feel free to open an issue.**
